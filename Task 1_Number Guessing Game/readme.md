## 📌 Project Description

This is a simple **command-line based number guessing game** built in Java as part of the CODSOFT Internship tasks.  
The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has a limited number of chances to guess it correctly.

## 🧠 Game Rules

- The system generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- You have a **maximum of 3 attempts per round** to guess the correct number.
- After each guess:

  - If the guess is wrong → hints are provided: "greater" or "lesser".
- After 3 failed guesses:
  - You can choose to **play again** (up to 3 rounds total).
  - Or **exit the game** by entering `n`.
